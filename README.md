# WinKeyDisabler
Automatically disable the Windows button when running a full screen
application (such as a game).

Simply run this program and leave it running minimized in the
background. When it detects that you are running any application in
full screen mode, it will intercept all presses of the Start button
and prevent you from unintentionally switching away from your
application. You can still leave your application by using other
standard global keystrokes, such as Alt-Tab, Alt-F4, or Ctrl-Esc.
