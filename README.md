# StartButtonDisabler
Automatically disable the Windows Start button when running a full screen app (such as a game).

Simply run this program and leave it running minimized in the background. When it detects that you are running any application in full screen mode, it will intercept all presses of the Start button and prevent you from unintentionally switching away from your application. You can still leave your application by using other global keystrokes, such as Alt-Tab.
